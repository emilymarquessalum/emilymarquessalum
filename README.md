## Looking at my profile because of flutter?
I worked in 4 different projects in iTec, but those are private and I can't link to them.  
### Last flutter public projects:
- [AgendaMed](https://github.com/SmartAgendaMed/app_smart_agendaMed): BLOC, GoRouter;
- [UniCredit](https://github.com/Uni-Credit/Uni-Credit-Frontend/tree/main): BLoC, Auto Route, Deploys to firebase web (was made for mobile but that was the simplest starting approach for testing remotely);
